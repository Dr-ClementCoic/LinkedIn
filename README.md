I - [Dr. ClÃ©ment CoÃ¯c](https://www.linkedin.com/in/clementcoic/) - share technology bits and pieces about (Model-Based) System Engineering and post them on LinkedIn.
In the long run, these bits and pieces will be included in the open-source book [Model Driven Engineering](https://github.com/Dr-ClementCoic/model-driven-engineering) (MDD).

To make these bits and pieces even more available, this repository hosts the files shared on LinkedIn, the source file and will be re-written as `markdown` documents for better versioning and reuse within the MDD book.

Feel free to leverage this material! Citations are welcome though - to spread the word ðŸ™‚.
